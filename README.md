=========

Hadfield-1 is a near-space balloon being designed and built by Nicholas Kanhai and Jonathan Barton.
Its main goals are to:
- obtain an altitude close to 100k feet
- capture automated aerial photography of the horizon and land below
- monitor and record sensor data about the payload and its environment

In order to monitor and record sensor data, we are leveraging a Raspberry Pi and its GPIO capabilities to perform these tasks.
